# Simple Calculator

## Description

This Python code performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on two user-provided numbers.

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the code using Python: python calculator.py
Enter the first number when prompted.
Enter the operator (+, -, *, or /).
Enter the second number.
The result of the calculation will be displayed.
## Example

Enter first number: 10
Enter operator: +
Enter second number: 5
15
## Considerations

The code currently only handles valid numerical inputs. It will crash if non-numeric values are entered.
Error handling could be added to make the code more robust.
Additional features could be implemented, such as:
Accepting decimal numbers
Handling more complex operators (e.g., exponents, square roots)
Creating a loop for continuous calculations
Building a graphical user interface (GUI)
This is my first project so I'm still learning.
